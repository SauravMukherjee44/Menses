- Menses Shop ( e-commerce): It provides home delivery of menstrual products to all menstruating women, Disabled people, and unrepresented genders.
- Menses Learn (educational platform): It provides content about best practices during menstruation, and 1:1 Counselling sessions to educate people.
- Community (open conversation and community): It is a community of all menstruating women to discuss their queries and lifestyle with the folks in the community.
